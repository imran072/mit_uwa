Smart Garbage Bin IoT Project README
Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a Smart Garbage Bin IoT project developed as part of an academic endeavor. The project aims to create an intelligent waste management system that monitors bin capacity, detects motion, and provides real-time data visualization through a cloud-based platform. The system utilizes ultrasonic sensors, LEDs, a servo motor, and an ESP32 microcontroller, integrated with the Arduino IoT Cloud platform for remote monitoring and control.

Project Components
Hardware Solution

Cost: The project adhered to a budget of $50 for additional components. University-provided materials included the ESP32, Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi, breadboard, jumper wires, servo motor, resistors, LEDs, and ultrasonic sensors.
Availability: All components were locally sourced within Perth, Western Australia, to meet project deadlines.
Size: The prototype's size was optimized to fit within a standard bin without affecting capacity.
Power Requirements: Power management emphasized efficiency, with the motor activated only when detecting an object, conserving energy through intelligent duty cycle management.
Communication Ability

Wi-Fi connectivity was chosen for its widespread availability, making it suitable for commercial deployment.
The ESP32 FireBeetle microcontroller was selected for its compact size, affordability, and compatibility with Wi-Fi communication.
Sensors

Ultrasonic sensors were used to measure bin capacity and detect approaching objects.
Although an IR sensor was considered, availability issues led to the exclusive use of ultrasonic sensors.
Servo Motor

The Fitec FS90 servo motor was employed to open the bin lid, conserving power by operating only when necessary.
Power consumption was minimized by activating the motor selectively based on detected motion.
Microcontroller

The ESP32 FireBeetle microcontroller was chosen for its compact size, affordability, and compatibility with the project requirements.
Software
Autonomous Operations and Decision Logic

Local data acquisition and management were handled by the Arduino microcontroller, which processed sensor data to determine bin status and control actuators accordingly.
Data Transmission to the Server

Data exchange with the cloud server was facilitated through the Arduino IoT Cloud platform, ensuring secure and efficient communication.
Wi-Fi connectivity and specific network credentials were configured to enable wireless communication with the cloud.
Cloud-Based Data Management and Analytics

Data collected from the bin was stored and managed on a cloud server, allowing for analytics, usage monitoring, and optimization of waste management strategies.
User Interface and Interaction

A user-friendly dashboard provided real-time visualization of bin status, usage analytics, and capacity levels.
LED indicators and servo motor actions were synchronized with cloud data for seamless user interaction.
